# EnderLink WebSocket
The **bridge** that powers EnderLink’s connection between **Minecraft** and **Discord** (or other platforms).  
This WebSocket server relays all chat and event data, making real-time communication possible.  
  

### Small note
If you decide to not create your own websocket but use the default provided websocket (`james.vacso.cloud:10000` or `ws.james.vacso.cloud`) you might wonder what code this runs and how privacy focused it is.  
Our websocket runs exactly this code that you can find here. All changes we make on our own websocket are pushed to this github repo.  
This both for our self (version control) and for you so you can easily view what is running the websocket and how it works.  

---

## ✅ Supported Environment
- **Node.js:** Latest LTS version recommended  
- **NPM:** Comes bundled with Node.js  
- Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

**Do not:**
- Run this WS in a Pterodactyl or Containerd (Docker) setup where it can not bind to `localhost` or `0.0.0.0 (all interfaces)`. Specially if you are hosting the Minecraft server on the same VPS/Machine.
- Set this up if you dont know what you are doing. If you dont understand it just use our own websocket! (`james.vacso.cloud:10000` or `ws.james.vacso.cloud`)

## 💡 What It Does
The WebSocket acts as the middleman between your Minecraft server and Discord bot.  
Whenever an event occurs, it travels like this:  
```
Minecraft → WebSocket → Discord Bot
Discord Bot → WebSocket → Minecraft
```
It’s lightweight, fast, and simple to host.

## 🔧 Requirements
You’ll need:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for cloning the repository  
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and NPM for installing dependencies  

---

## 🛠️ Setup Guide
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/finnjosten/EnderLinkWebsocket.git
   cd EnderLinkWebsocket
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the Server**  
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   By default, the server will start and listen on the configured port.
4. **(Optional but suggeted) Run with PM2**
   - Install PM2 `npm install -g pm2`
   - Start the server `pm2 start server.js --name EnderLinkWS`
   - Use PM2 commands to control the server `pm2 stop EnderLinkWS`|`pm2 logs EnderLinkWS`|`pm2 restart EnderLinkWS` and many more.
6. **(Optional) Change the Port**
   - Open `server.js`.
   - Locate the port configuration and adjust it as needed (line `7` & `8`).
   - Restart the server for the change to take effect.
7. **(Optional) Reverse Proxy with Nginx**
   - Only set this up if you have experience with Nginx and want a more advanced configuration.
   - For simple setups, running the WebSocket directly is recommended.

## 🎯 Tips

Keep the WebSocket running in the background using tools like pm2 or a systemd service for production environments.  
If hosting publicly, secure the connection (e.g., via WSS) for extra protection.
